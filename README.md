# Agropoint

AgroPoint is an app which will make it easier for consumers to support smallholder farmers while purchasing high quality agricultural products. The platform is aimed at unifying the rural communities through an easier access to market. In many cities across the world supermarkets became the standard which damages the income of the small-scale farmers due to the current market structure. We want to persuade all small-scale farmers along with the consumers to be more proactive and support each other. Our easy-to-use app encourages more people to start farming, helping minority groups and novices, which will make our world a more sustainable place.
